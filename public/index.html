        <p class="p1">
          Strings: Uses nylon strings, which were originally made of gut. The bass strings are wound with metal, but the
          core is
          nylon. Nylon strings are softer to the touch and easier on the fingers
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
          Sound: Produces a mellow, warm, and rounded tone.Typically used in
          classical, Samba, and folk music.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">
          Neck: The neck is usually wider, which allows more space between the
          strings. This is helpful for fingerstyle playing

      <div>
        <p class="p2">
          Strings: Uses steel strings, which are much harder than nylon strings.
          These are more common in modern music, including rock, pop, country, and
          folk.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Sound: Produces a brighter, louder, and more resonant sound with more
          sustain than nylon strings. The tone is crisper, making it well-suited
          for strumming and picking.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
          Neck: The neck is usually narrower than that of a nylon guitar, which
          can make it easier for playing chords, but the strings are tighter and
          can be harder on the fingers.

      <div>
        <p class="p3">
          Strings: Uses steel strings, but they are generally thinner than those on acoustic guitars. These strings rely
          on
          magnetic pickups rather than the guitar's body to produce sound.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
          Sound: The sound is produced primarily through electronic pickups that convert string vibrations into
          electrical
          signals, which are then amplified. The sound can be modified using effects pedals or through the amplifier to
          create a
          wide range of tones, from clean to highly distorted.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
          Neck: The neck can vary in size, but itâ€™s often slimmer than both classical and steel-string acoustic guitars,
          facilitating faster playing styles like lead guitar or intricate solos.

      <h3>My personal experience</h3>
      <p>Playing guitar has been an incredible journey for me, starting with a nylon-string classical guitar. The softer
        strings
        made it easier to learn fingerpicking, and the mellow tone was perfect for folk and classical music. Moving to a
        steel-string acoustic was a challenge, with tougher strings but a brighter, more resonant sound ideal for rock
        and pop.
        Finally, picking up an electric guitar opened up a world of sound possibilities with its fast playability and
        variety of
        tones. Each guitar taught me something new, and playing has become a rewarding way to express myself and explore
        creativity.</p>
